Problem Statement:
Detect error messages from system logs.

# Given Logs
logs = ["INFO", "ERROR", "WARNING", "ERROR"]

# Start counting from 0
error_count = 0

# Check each entry in the logs
for entry in logs:
    # If the entry matches exactly "ERROR"
    if entry == "ERROR":
        # Add 1 to our counter
        error_count += 1

# Print the total
print(f"Total Errors Found: {error_count}")
