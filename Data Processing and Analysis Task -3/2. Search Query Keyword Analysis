Problem Statement 2: Search Query Keyword Analysis
Description:
An e-commerce website stores customer search queries. 
You are given a search query sentence entered by a user.

# The input string
query = "Buy mobile phone buy phone online"

# Preprocess: Make lowercase and split into words
words = query.lower().split()

# Create a dictionary to store counts
counts = {}
for w in words:
    counts[w] = counts.get(w, 0) + 1

# Filter for words that appear more than once
# This creates the final dictionary using a simple loop
result = {}
for word, count in counts.items():
    if count > 1:
        result[word] = count

# Output the result
print(result)
