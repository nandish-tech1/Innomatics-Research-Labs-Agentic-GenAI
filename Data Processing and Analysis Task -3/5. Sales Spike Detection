Problem Statement 5: Sales Spike Detection
Description:
A retail company tracks daily sales. Sudden spikes in sales may indicate promotions or unusual activity.

# Given sales Data
sales = [1200, 1500, 900, 2200, 1400, 3000]

# Calculate the average daily sales
average_sales = sum(sales) / len(sales)

# Define the spike threshold (30% above average)
threshold = average_sales * 1.30

print(f"Average Sales: {average_sales:.2f}")
print(f"Spike Threshold: {threshold:.2f}")
print("-" * 25)

# Detect and display spikes
# We use i+1 because list indices start at 0, but days start at 1
for i, value in enumerate(sales):
    if value > threshold:
        print(f"Day {i + 1}: {value}")
