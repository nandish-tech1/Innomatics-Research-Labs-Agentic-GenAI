Problem Statement 6: Duplicate User ID Detection
Description:
A system stores user IDs during registration. Duplicate IDs can cause data integrity issues.

# Given Userids
user_ids = ["user1", "user2", "user1", "user3", "user1", "user3"]

# Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each user ID
id_counts = {}

for uid in user_ids:
    # Increment the count if the ID exists, otherwise start at 1
    id_counts[uid] = id_counts.get(uid, 0) + 1

# Identify and display only the duplicates (count > 1)
print("Duplicate User ID Detection:")
for uid, count in id_counts.items():
    if count > 1:
        print(f"{uid} → {count} times")
