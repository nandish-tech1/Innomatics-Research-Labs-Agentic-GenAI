Problem Statement 3: Sensor Data Validation
Description:
A factory collects sensor readings every hour. Each reading is stored in a list where the index represents the hour and the value represents the sensor reading.

# Input list of sensor readings
sensor_readings = [3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 5]

# Using a list comprehension to filter even readings
# 'i' represents the hour index, 'val' represents the reading
valid_readings = [(i, val) for i, val in enumerate(sensor_readings) if val % 2 == 0]

# Displaying the results
print("Valid Sensor Readings (Hour, Value):")
print(valid_readings)
