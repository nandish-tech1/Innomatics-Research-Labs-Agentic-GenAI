Calculate the average marks of a student from a list of marks.

# Given Data
marks = [80, 65, 90, 55]

# 1. Calculate the sum of all marks
total_sum = sum(marks)

# 2. Find out how many subjects there are
total_subjects = len(marks)

# 3. Divide sum by count to get the average
average = total_sum / total_subjects

# 4. Display the result
print(f"Average Marks: {average}")
