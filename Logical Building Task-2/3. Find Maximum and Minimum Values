Problem Statement
Find the maximum and minimum values from a list of numbers.

# Given Numbers 
numbers = [45, 22, 89, 10, 66]

# Start by assuming the first number is both the max and min
max_val = numbers[0]
min_val = numbers[0]

# Loop through the list to compare
for n in numbers:
    # Update max if we find a bigger number
    if n > max_val:
        max_val = n
    
    # Update min if we find a smaller number
    if n < min_val:
        min_val = n

# Display results
print(f"List: {numbers}")
print(f"Max: {max_val}")
print(f"Min: {min_val}")
