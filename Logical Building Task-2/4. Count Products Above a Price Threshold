Problem Statement
Count how many products have a price greater than 1000.

# List of product prices
prices = [450, 1200, 899, 1500, 300]

# Start our counter at 0
count = 0

# Look at each price in the list
for p in prices:
    # Check if the price is above 1000
    if p > 1000:
        count += 1 # Add 1 to our counter if true

# Show the final result
print(f"Products above 1000: {count}")
