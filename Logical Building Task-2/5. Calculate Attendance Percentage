Problem Statement
Calculate the attendance percentage from a list containing "P" (Present) and "A" (Absent).

# Given Attendence

attendance = ["P", "P", "A", "P", "P"]

# Count the number of "P" (Present) entries
present_count = attendance.count("P")

# Get the total number of days in the list
total_days = len(attendance)

# Calculate the percentage
# (Presents divided by Total) multiplied by 100
percentage = (present_count / total_days) * 100

# Show the final result
print(f"Attendance Percentage: {percentage}")
